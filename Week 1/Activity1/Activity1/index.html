    <h3>What Programming Language do you want to learn?</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
      <p>
        Why Python?, I choose Python as 1 of my favorite programming language
        because it is easy to learn, highly readable, has a vast library of
        pre-built functions, and is widely used for web development, data
        analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.
      </p>

      <li><strong>SQL</strong></li>
      <p>
        I would choose SQL as my programming language because it excels at
        managing and querying databases efficiently. It offers a simple syntax
        for data manipulation and retrieval, making it ideal for handling large
        datasets and performing complex operations. SQL's widespread adoption
        and compatibility with various database systems also make it a valuable
        skill in many industries.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Javascript</strong></li>
      <p>
        I'd choose JavaScript for its versatility in creating interactive web
        pages and server-side applications. Its large community and extensive
        libraries provide great support for various types of projects.
